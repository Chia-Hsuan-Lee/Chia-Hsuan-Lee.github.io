Hi! Nice to meet you! I am **Chia-Hsuan (Michael) Lee (李佳軒)**.
I am currently a  third-year PhD student at University of Washington, where I work in the [Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.washington.edu/) with [Prof. Mari Ostendorf](https://people.ece.uw.edu/ostendorf/).

My research interests are deep learning/machine learning and their applications in natural language processing. 
My recent research interests are 
- dialogue systems ([IC-DST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08568), [SGP-DST](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.404/))
- text-to-SQL parsing ([KaggleDBQA](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.176/), [IC-DST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08568))
- multilingual NLP ([DOCmT5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08709), [CLQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06042))

Previously I spent great years at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) working with [Prof. Lin-Shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and [Prof. Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/) on spoken question answering ([Spoken-SQuAD](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/pdfs/interspeech_2018/lee18d_interspeech.pdf). [ODSQA](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8639505), [Adversarial Learning SQA](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8683377)).
