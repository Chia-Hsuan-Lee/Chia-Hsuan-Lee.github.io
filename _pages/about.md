Hi! Nice to meet you! 
I am **Chia-Hsuan (Michael) Lee**, currently an applied researcher at Capital One AI foundation team working on language model alignment.
I obtained PhD from the University of Washington where I was advised by [Prof. Mari Ostendorf](https://people.ece.uw.edu/ostendorf/) in the [Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.washington.edu/). I also worked with [Prof. Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/). 

I was a research intern at Google Brain (2022), co-hosted by [Ankur Bapna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6xaz-r0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EilVnKwAAAAJ&hl=en); interned at Google Research (2021), hosted by [Melvin Johnson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g4oMRgsAAAAJ&hl=en); interned at Microsoft Research NLP group (2020), co-hosted by [Matthew Richardson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IT-vb_kAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Alex Polozov](https://alexpolozov.com/).

My primary research interests are language modeling and dialogue agents. More specifically: 
- **Language Modeling**: I explore new pretraining strategies for long-context language models ([DOCmT5 (NAACL 2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-naacl.32/). I study new in-context learning method [IC-DST (EMNLP 2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.193/) and prompt-tuning method ([SDP-DST (EMNLP 2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.404/) for language models. I propose a routing framework to dynamically orchestra multiple language models during inference ([OrchestraLLM (NAACL 2024)](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.79/)). I propose a correction framework that enables SLMs to self-correct using in-context exemplars without LLM involvement ([CorrectionLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18209)). 
- **Dialogue Agents**: My focus has been on task-oriented dialogues (structured information extraction), encompassing task-oriented prompting ([SDP-DST (EMNLP 2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.404/), few-shot learning with LLM [IC-DST (EMNLP 2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.193/), and data synthesis from LLM-human interaction ([DialGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07047)).


I served on organizing committees of [Multilingual Information Access Workshop](https://mia-workshop.github.io/) and program committees of [Structured and Unstructured Knowledge Integration Workshop](https://suki-workshop.github.io/organization). I review for EMNLP, ACL, NAACL, COLING, and ARR.
