Hi! Nice to meet you! I am Chia-Hsuan (Michael) Lee (李佳軒), currently a second year PhD student at University of Washington, where I work in the [Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.washington.edu/) with [Prof. Mari Ostendorf](http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/people/mo/).

My research interests are deep learning/machine learning and their applications in natural language processing. My recent research interests are open-domain question answering, dialogue systems and text-to-SQL parsing. Broadly speaking, I am interested in language understanding and interpretability of deep learning models.

Previously I spent great years at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) working with [Prof. Lin-Shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and [Prof. Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/) on question answering. 

This is my updated CV: (<a href="files/CV_0508.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>)
