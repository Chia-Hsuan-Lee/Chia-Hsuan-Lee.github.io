Hi! Nice to meet you! I am **Chia-Hsuan (Michael) Lee (李佳軒)**.
I am a fifth-year PhD student at University of Washington, where I am advised by [Prof. Mari Ostendorf](https://people.ece.uw.edu/ostendorf/) in the [Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.washington.edu/). I also work closely with [Prof. Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/).

My research interests are deep learning/machine learning and their applications in natural language processing. 
My recent research interests are 
- **Conversational AI** ([SDP-DST (EMNLP 2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.404/), [IC-DST (EMNLP 2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.193/), [OrchestraLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09758.pdf))
- **text-to-SQL parsing** ([KaggleDBQA (ACL2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.176/), [IC-DST (EMNLP 2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.193/))
- **multilingual NLP** ([DOCmT5 (NAACL 2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-naacl.32/),  [CLQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06042))

I was also fortunate to be advised by [Matthew Richardson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IT-vb_kAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Alex Polozov](https://alexpolozov.com/) at [Microsoft Research NLP group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-processing/people/), [Melvin Johnson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g4oMRgsAAAAJ&hl=en) at Google Research, [Ankur Bapna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6xaz-r0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EilVnKwAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Google Brain Research](https://research.google/teams/brain/). 

I served on organzing comittees of [Multilingual Information Access Workshop](https://mia-workshop.github.io/) and program committees of [Structured and Unstructured Knowledge Integration Workshop](https://suki-workshop.github.io/organization). I review for EMNLP, ACL, NAACL, COLING and ARR. 

I have a Master's degree in computer science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) working with [Prof. Lin-Shan Lee](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=23zBJqIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [Prof. Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/) and [Prof. Yun-Nung Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) on spoken question answering ([Spoken-SQuAD](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/pdfs/interspeech_2018/lee18d_interspeech.pdf), [ODSQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07904), [Adversarial Learning SQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02280)).
