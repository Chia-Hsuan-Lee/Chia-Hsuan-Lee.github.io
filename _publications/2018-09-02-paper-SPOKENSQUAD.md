## Abstract
Reading comprehension has been widely studied. One of the
most representative reading comprehension tasks is Stanford
Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), on which machine is
already comparable with human. On the other hand, accessing
large collections of multimedia or spoken content is much
more difficult and time-consuming than plain text content for
humans. Itâ€™s therefore highly attractive to develop machines
which can automatically understand spoken content. In this paper,
we propose a new listening comprehension task - Spoken
SQuAD. On the new task, we found that speech recognition errors
have catastrophic impact on machine comprehension, and
several approaches are proposed to mitigate the impact.
